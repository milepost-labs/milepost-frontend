/**
 * Contract errors, translated.
 *
 * The contracts return around fifty typed errors across five crates. Raw, they
 * are useless to a person: `WrongPhase` means nothing, while "Applications
 * closed on 3 March — this programme is now under review" says what happened
 * and what to do about it.
 *
 * Several of these are not faults at all. `NothingToRefund` usually means a
 * programme paid out in full, and `NotFound` for standing simply means someone
 * has no track record yet. Presenting those as failures would be wrong, so
 * every entry carries a kind that decides how it should be shown.
