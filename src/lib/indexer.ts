/**
 * The published index.
 *
 * The contracts store everything under per-address keys and keep no lists, so
 * there is no on-chain way to ask "who holds an award in this programme?".
 * [milepost-indexer](https://github.com/milepost-labs/milepost-indexer) reads
 * the events, rebuilds the lists and publishes them as static JSON every ten
 * minutes.
 *
 * **A list here says where to look, never what is true.** Every entry must be
 * read back from the contract before the app shows it as fact: the index can
 * be minutes behind, and a wrong entry must only ever cost an extra read, not
 * put something false on screen. A failed fetch is likewise not an error worth
 * blocking a screen for — fall back to whatever the page can do without it.
